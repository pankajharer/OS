#  Operating System Algorithms Implementation  

This repository contains **implementations of fundamental Operating System (OS) algorithms**, including **CPU scheduling, page replacement, and deadlock avoidance techniques**. These algorithms play a crucial role in **process management, memory management, and system efficiency**.

## ** Included Algorithms**  

 **CPU Scheduling Algorithms:**  
-  **First Come First Serve (FCFS)** ‚Äì Non-preemptive scheduling where the process that arrives first gets executed first.  
-  **Priority Scheduling (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive)** ‚Äì Executes processes based on priority levels.  
-  **Round Robin Scheduling** ‚Äì Time-sharing scheduling with equal time slices.  
-  **Shortest Job First (SJF) (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive)** ‚Äì Selects the shortest process first to optimize turnaround time.  

 **Page Replacement Algorithms:**  
-  **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** ‚Äì Removes the oldest page from memory when a new one is needed.  
-  **LRU (Least Recently Used)** ‚Äì Replaces the page that has been least recently used.  
-  **Optimal Page Replacement** ‚Äì Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest time.  

 **Deadlock Avoidance Algorithm:**  
-  **Banker‚Äôs Algorithm** ‚Äì Ensures safe resource allocation to prevent deadlocks.  

 **Process Synchronization Algorithm:**  
-  **Sleeping Barber Problem** ‚Äì Classic synchronization problem using semaphores.
